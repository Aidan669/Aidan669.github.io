    <p>I was born and raised in Toronto, but began studyig at Brock University in St. Catherines.
      I started photography in high school with a film photography course, which lead to the purchase of my first DSLR.
      Since then I have been learning on my own, the tricks and techniques of the trait.
      I believe that I get better with each picture I take. I would conisider myslef an amateur,
      but have no desire to stop there, and consatntly look for new people, places and things to
      capture through my lens. My style of shooting has a wide range. I really like long exposure
      photography, but I will photograph anything that catches my eye.
