  <h4>Who are Daft Punk ? Daft Punk are an electronic music duo consisting of French
  musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. Daft Punk reached
  significant popularity in the late 1990s house movement in France and met
  with continued success in the years following, combining elements of house
  with synthpop. The duo's songs are considered essential in the French house
  scene. The group was managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the
  head of Ed Banger Records. Early in the group's career, the band members
  were influenced by groups including The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones.</h4>
