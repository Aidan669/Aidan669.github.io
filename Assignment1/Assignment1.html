<h2>Information</h2>


  <p class="font" id= "color"> Who are Daft Punk ? Daft Punk are an electronic music duo consisting of French
  musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. Daft Punk reached
  significant popularity in the late 1990s house movement in France and met
  with continued success in the years following, combining elements of house
  with synthpop. The duo's songs are considered essential in the French house
  scene. The group was managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the
  head of Ed Banger Records. Early in the group's career, the band members
  were influenced by groups including The Beach Boys and The Rolling Stones.</p>

<p class="font" id="text-style">Bangalter and de
  Homem-Christo were originally in a rock band called
  Darlin', which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to
  experiment musically on their own. The duo became Daft Punk, releasing its
  debut album Homework in 1997 to highly positive reviews. The 2001 release of
  Discovery was even more successful, driven by the club singles "One More
  Time", "Digital Love", and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". In March 2005,
 the duo released the album Human After All to mixed reviews. However, the
singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" achieved success in the United Kingdom.

Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive
2007, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. The duo
composed the score of the film Tron: Legacy and in 2010 released the soundtrack
 album of the film. In January 2013, Daft Punk left EMI Records for Sony Music
 Entertainment's subsidiary label Columbia, and released Random Access Memories
 in 2013 to worldwide critical acclaim. The lead single "Get Lucky" became an
 international success, peaking in the top 10 in 32 countries.
 Random Access Memories led to five Grammy wins in 2014 including Album of
 the Year, as well as Record of the Year for "Get Lucky".

The group is known for emphasising using visual and story components
associated with their musical productions, and for using disguises while in
public and/or performing; specifically ornate helmets and gloves to assume
robot personas in most of their public appearances since 2001.
The duo rarely grant interviews or appear on television.</p>
