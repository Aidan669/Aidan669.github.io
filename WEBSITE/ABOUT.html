    <p>I was born and raised in Toronto, but began studying at Brock University in St. Catherines in September of 2015. I am a passionate cyclist,
      music enthusiast, and bike shop mechanic. I started photography in high school with a film photography course, which lead to the purchase of my first digital SLR.
      Since then I have been learning through trial and error, but also from other photagraphers and their works.
      I believe that I get better with each picture taken. I would conisider myslef an amateur,
      but have no desire to stop there, and consatntly look for new people, places and things to
      capture through my lens. My style of shooting has a wide range. I really like long exposure
      photography, but I will photograph anything that catches my eye. The pictures displayed on this site all have some sort of meaning or
      little story attatched to them.
      If you're reading this, thanks for visiting the page!
